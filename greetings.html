				<p>I think that I've ran out of grand things to say to you that you don't already know yet. We've honestly been through a lot over the years, so many changes has happened since then. I'm just thankful that we found the time to talk things through and patch up old wounds - and really just open our hearts about the past and future. We're taking the right steps towards improvement, no matter how hard and tiring it may be. </p>
				<p>I want this sword to represent the beautiful things we are yet to unlock in our journey as father and son. As cheesy as it is, I think that this is a good way to think about the future. In the end, love is the greatest power we share and hold. So, I want you to know that whenever you don't feel well, we're always here for you and that we're in this together. We'll always be there to support you every step of the way. We more than love you Dad! <3</p>
